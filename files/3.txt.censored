This message is only relevant for those going to UBS.
...

It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to copy all documents yourself.

This is my cheat sheet if it helps:  

████████:
1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.  
2. █████: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on ████████ █████.

████████:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  ████████████ and M will be removed from UBS employees on ████████ █████.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.
